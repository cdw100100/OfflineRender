To Fix:

1. Asset Overwriting:
   - Ensure that downloaded assets (images, CSS files) do not overwrite each other by saving them 
     with unique names or in dedicated folders.

2. Error Handling:
   - Improve error handling during downloads to account for missing or inaccessible resources, 
     ensuring the script continues running without crashing.

3. Download Progress Indication:
   - Add a progress bar or percentage indicator to provide users with a visual representation of 
     the download status.

4. UI Improvements:
   - Enhance the user interface for better usability, such as adding a cancel button or status messages 
     to inform users about the current operation.

5. Duplicate Downloads:
   - Implement more robust checks to avoid downloading the same asset or page multiple times, 
     especially when navigating nested links.

6. Thread Management:
   - Optimize thread management to prevent the application from freezing or becoming unresponsive 
     during the download process.

7. Documentation:
   - Add comments and documentation within the code to clarify the functionality of key sections 
     for future maintenance and updates.
