Website Downloader Script

This script is designed to download an entire website, including its HTML pages and associated assets 
such as images, CSS files, and other resources. Using a user-friendly graphical interface built with 
Tkinter, users can input a URL and initiate the download process.

Key Features:
- Recursive Downloading: The script fetches the main page and recursively downloads linked pages 
  within the same domain.
- Asset Management: All assets (images, CSS files) are downloaded and organized into a dedicated 
  "assets" folder to maintain a clean directory structure.
- Multi-threading Support: By utilizing a ThreadPoolExecutor, the script efficiently downloads multiple 
  pages and assets simultaneously, speeding up the overall process.
- Download Tracking: The script keeps track of visited pages and downloaded assets to avoid redundancy, 
  ensuring each resource is only downloaded once.
- Progress Logging: Users receive real-time feedback on the download progress through a scrolling text 
  box, displaying messages for successfully downloaded pages and any errors encountered.

This script serves as a powerful tool for anyone looking to archive websites or gather content for 
offline viewing.
